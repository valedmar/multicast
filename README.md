# multicast

A simple python program to cast a youtube video to all available chromecasts on LAN




### TODO:
- [x] Proof of concept
- [ ] Multithreading, to speed up casting
- [x] Debug mode // something to show off the names of the devices

***

## Disclaimer:
*I don't condone using this tool on chromecasts you don't have permission to.*
